## 1.0 Short Lecture – What Is Phishing? (10–12 min)

Phishing is digital manipulation. It's not about code—it's about *you*.

**Key Talking Points:**

- Explain that attackers weaponize emotion: urgency, fear, authority, greed  
- Introduce the “Just Doesn’t Look Right” principle as a survival skill  
- Highlight the *pause before panic* concept

*Close with a callout:*

## 3.0 Creative Team Activity – Build a Phish (20–25 min)

**Instructions:**

**Optional Constraints:**
- Give teams a “scenario card” to inspire them (e.g., fake invoice, HR email, IT request)

**Debrief:**

## 🧭 Notes for Instructor

- Keep slides to a minimum—consider 3–5 visuals max  
- Focus on storytelling, not tech jargon  
- Prepare one or two real phishing examples ahead of time  
- If possible, collect the team phishes for later use in quizzes or follow-up content
