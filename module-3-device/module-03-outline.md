## 🔐 1.0 Lecture – Device and Workspace Risks (12–15 min)

### Core Topics:
- **Unlocked devices**: attacker jackpot  
- **Tailgating**: piggybacking through doors, unchallenged  
- **USB baiting**: malware disguised as generosity  
- **Shoulder surfing**: lo-fi spying, hi-fi damage  
- **Clean desk**: fewer notes = fewer leaks  

### 🧠 Embedded Concepts

> “An attacker’s best friend is some quiet time alone on a trusted connection.”

> **Situational Awareness Check**  
> “If you work in a cubicle or bullpen environment:  
> - Can you name who sits around you?  
> - Could you spot someone who doesn’t belong?”

### 🔍 Environmental Design – Friend or Foe?

> “Is your monitor facing a hallway? Can people read it as they walk by?”  
> “Do you sit with your back to the door?”

- Many “open workspaces” prioritize culture over confidentiality
- Even **legitimate employees** seeing the wrong thing = **a breach**
- Minor changes (e.g., monitor placement) can make major improvements

🎯 *Takeaway:*  
> “Security isn’t just about malware. It’s about **who can see what, when, and why**.”

## 🧭 2.0 Discussion – Spot the Slips (10–12 min)

Ask:
> “What’s wrong here? What’s the risk? What would you do differently?”

## 🧪 3.0 Activity – Secure or Sketchy? (15–20 min)

- Justify their reasoning + recommend safer habits

*Bonus Option:*

  - Notice who’s in your area
